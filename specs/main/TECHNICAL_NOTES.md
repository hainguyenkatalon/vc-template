# TECHNICAL_NOTES

- Entry points for the current iteration are the helper scripts `specs/tools/spec-bootstrap.sh` and `specs/tools/gen-spec-context.sh`; they set up spec docs and regenerate `SPEC_CONTEXT.md`.
- No application modules are documented yet because `SPEC.md` is still empty; once requirements exist, map the relevant packages/functions here.
