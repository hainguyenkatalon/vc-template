VC Template — Codex Working Style Base

This folder contains a generic working style scaffold for agent-driven development:
- AGENTS.md — execution flow and conventions
- specs/tools — shared helper scripts (build, bootstrap, loop helpers)

Branch-specific specs (e.g., specs/<branch>/) are intentionally not included.
