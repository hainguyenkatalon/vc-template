VC Template — Codex Working System

This folder contains a generic working style scaffold for agent-driven development:
- `AGENTS.md` — repo-agnostic execution flow and conventions (do not edit; keep it concise).
- `REPO_WAY_OF_WORKING.md` — repo-specific coding and collaboration conventions (safe to edit).
- `specs/tools` — shared helper scripts (bootstrap and automation helpers).

Working style is layered: repo-agnostic (`AGENTS.md`), repo-specific (`REPO_WAY_OF_WORKING.md`), and branch-specific (`specs/<branch>/WAY_OF_WORKING.md`).
