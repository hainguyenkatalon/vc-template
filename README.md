VC Template — Codex Working Style Base

This folder contains a generic working style scaffold for agent-driven development:
- `AGENTS.md` — execution flow and conventions
- `specs/tools` — shared helper scripts (bootstrap and automation helpers)

Branch-specific specs (e.g., `specs/<branch>/`) are intentionally not included.
